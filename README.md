## Introduction

A mod for Slay the Spire which adds [**The Lost**](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lost) from The Binding of Isaac as a playable character.

## Gameplay / Mechanics
Just like in Binding of Isaac, The Lost only has 1 HP. But thankfully, you have some powerful tools to help offset this.
### Tears
At the end of your turn, gain Block equal to your Tears stacks. Lose half your Tears at the start of your turn.
### Evil
If you have 10 or more Evil, spend 10 Evil to gain 1 Energy, 2 Strength, and draw 1 card.
### Purity
Orb. Passive: Deal damage to a random enemy. Evoke: Gain Focus.
### Nebula
This turn, when you're attacked, deal damage back.

## Notes

### Art
Currently, there is no custom fireplace art or ending artwork for beating the Heart, and all the card art is recolored base game art. It's the best I can currently do, since I am not an artist.
### Bugs
This mod will likely break if using the Googly Eyes mod since The Lost is a single still image. Other bugs can be reported to the relevant Steam Discussion.
